# Rag-Tag Project

## Introduction

The Rag-Tag project is an experimental endeavor aimed at exploring the capabilities of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This project focuses on leveraging a tag-document relationship to perform Vector Similarity Search (VSS) in an innovative manner. The primary goal is to enhance information retrieval processes by efficiently associating tags with documents, thereby facilitating more accurate and relevant search results.

## Purpose

The Rag-Tag project seeks to create a system where users can interact with a simple front-end interfaceâ€”a single page that loads conversation JSON data. Users can input queries, which are then processed by the RAG API to perform VSS. The system returns a list of documents and their corresponding scores, highlighting matching messages (documents) in the conversation by rendering their background in green. This visual feedback mechanism aims to provide users with an intuitive understanding of the relevance and relationship between their queries and the retrieved documents.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-End**: A single-page application (SPA) for user interaction.
- **Back-End**: Implementation of the RAG architecture and VSS, likely involving technologies such as Python for algorithm development and API services.
- **Database**: Storage of documents and tags, with a focus on efficient retrieval mechanisms. The specific database technology is yet to be determined.
- **Notebooks**: Use of Jupyter notebooks to provide backend examples and to document the experimental results and methodologies.
